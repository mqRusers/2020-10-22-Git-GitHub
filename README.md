# Git-GitHub
An introduction to all things Git

## Description

Are you wanting to collaborate on R scripts? Or backup your RStudio work? This workshop will cover the basics of Git/GitHub and how it integrates with RStudio. We will discuss using Git and GitHub to back up your work, make your work available (including to collaborators), version control using Git and Github. This is the workshop for you if you have questions like: What are Git and GitHub? What does it mean if I need to commit or push? Is forking as strange as it sounds? How do I use R with Git and/or GitHub? Why would I use a project in RStudio? Why can’t I just email my code to my collaborator? 
 
No knowledge of Git or GitHub is required. Signing up for a GitHub account before the workshop is recommended if you want to practice your new RStudio and Git/GitHub skills alongside us. You can sign up for a GitHub account here: https://github.com 

If you would like to follow along with the workshop, we recommend you have a GitHub account and have R and RStudio installed prior to the workshop start.
 
You can find instructions for downloading R and RStudio [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html). If you have any trouble, we’ll be available to help you sort the issues 15 minutes before the workshop begins at the zoom link. Alternatively, you can use [RStudio in the cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).
